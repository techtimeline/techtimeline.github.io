  <h1>The new millenium of technology, welcome to the 2000s of Tech.</h1>
  <p>It's crazy how far we've gone into computers, Windows 98 is now the most used Operating System. MS-DOS computers and computers that have a command line interface are now considered obsolete. As more and more operating systems
      are starting to use UIs for simpler transportation between applications. Operating Systems & Technology have really started to help everyone.
      Using the Internet is easier than ever, and websites like Google & Amazon.com were just starting to become a thing. Here's the history in the 2000s.

            <p> Instead of having massive cameras and floppy disks, and more & more stuff just to take a couple of photos.
                Or going to the store to have your film turned into an actual picture, Digital Cameras became the new hit thing.
                
                They made taking pictures more comfortable & more enjoyable, rather than it being time-consuming and sometimes a waste of money. 
                But by having the picture on an LCD screen for you to see, or also saved onto a drive.

                Photos became easier to take than ever.
                Heck, I even still have one in my house.

            <p>At this time, having cable boxes and stuff like this wasn't relative to our native culture of watching Television.
                But in 2000, when the TiVo came it was a beautiful change. It wasn't you having to change the channels manually,
                it was a great UI telling you the Guides of when the shows were coming. Against having the TV Guide mailed to you.
                You can just check from the menu.

            <p>In the last era of the Walkman, listening to music on so called "mp3 players" was starting to become popular.
                But none of them did it the best, their flash memory was so bad it couldn't hold more than 1 song.
                But Apple returned to it's throne after being overthrown by Microsoft with the iPod.
                The iPod set a standard with MP3 players, one of it's selling points is that it could hold 1000 songs in your pocket.
                And at this time, this was revolutionary. The iPods' size and click wheel made it portable and compact.

                It still transforms the way we listen to music.

            <p>Dial-Up Connections & AOL were still a big thing. The low speeds at that time didn't bother us much since we weren't 
                used to high speed or for that matter; Wireless Connectivity. With the power of Wi-Fi, it truly changed the way we go online.
                
                Despite it not being that big in the 2000s, it did start to change a little soon later with the downfall of AOL & Netscape.

            <p>In a time of phones being relatively obsolete each coming year, Motorola was dominating the entire Flip Phone market.
                Of course, before iOS & Android. Times were simpler. The RAZR was made in 2003 and released in 2004.
                This was one of the most sold phones ever in the history of Flip Phones having LCD glass on the front of the phone and inside
                of the phones interials.

            <p>Windows XP is one of the greatest Operating Systems ever released, it was released in 2001 and is still one of the most
                used operating systems ever.
                Windows XP changed everything about a computer, instead of having regular Windows based on MS-DOS. This was aesthetically pleasing with it's Simple UI
                and still to this day Microsoft recieves praise for it.
                Windows XP was simple to use, the menus had drop shadows, and also had Wi-Fi support, new features in Windows Explorer and faster User Switching.
                And introduced Windows Update to the world.

           <center> <p>If you don't know what YouTube is. You truly live under a rock without any Wi-Fi.
                3 people went rogue against PayPal and created YouTube in 2005.
                Hosting videos online was expensive & hard. YouTube made it free and easy.
