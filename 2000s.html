  <h1>The new millenium of technology, welcome to the 2000s of Tech.</h1>
  <p>It's crazy how far we've gone into computers, Windows 98 is now the most used Operating System. MS-DOS computers and computers that have a command line interface are now considered obsolete. As more and more operating systems
      are starting to use UIs for simpler transportation between applications. Operating Systems & Technology have really started to help everyone.
      Using the Internet is easier than ever, and websites like Google & Amazon.com were just starting to become a thing. Here's the history in the 2000s.

            <p> Instead of having massive cameras and floppy disks, and more & more stuff just to take a couple of photos.
                Or going to the store to have your film turned into an actual picture, Digital Cameras became the new hit thing.
                
                They made taking pictures more comfortable & more enjoyable, rather than it being time-consuming and sometimes a waste of money. 
                But by having the picture on an LCD screen for you to see, or also saved onto a drive.

                Photos became easier to take than ever.
                Heck, I even still have one in my house.
