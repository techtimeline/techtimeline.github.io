        <center> <h2>Part 3 - Development of a Website</h2></center>
        <p>You will next create a website. This is most easily done by creating a free account on an online
            website creation service such as Weebly (the one I'm most familiar with) or Wix. From the design choices available,
            pick something that will be suitable to the content you will be including. The website should have six main sections,
            corresponding to the various time periods
            (1940s-1950s) (1960s-1970s) (1980s) (1990s) (2000s) (2010s)
            
            Add all information from your research notes onto the appropriate sections of your website. 
            The exact organization of information is up to you.
            
            On all six pages, also add at least two pieces of relevant media, such as images or videos.
        
        </p>
   <center> <h2>Evaluation</h2> </center> 
    <p> You will be evaluated (level based) on the completeness and correctness of your research notes, proper design of your website including required media, and the effective transfer of information from your research notes to your website.</p>
