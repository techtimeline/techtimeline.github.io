        <p>The 1980s were a great time, but instead of technology being closed for only developers. It was now becoming more open for everyone,
            with Personal Computers becoming a brand new thing. But now accesible, times were a changin.'

           <p>With iPhones, Android Phones, and all that. You would probably think this phone looks disgusting.
             This is the Motorola DynaTAC, the first cell phone of all time. The foundation for all cell phones.
             On September 21, 1983 this became a thing and phone calls were made on it.
             It used an antenna and again, you can make calls on it.

            <p>A lot of people actually don't know what MS-DOS is, or was.
            Well, here's a fun fact. Some preserved pieces of MS-DOS is actually still in your computer.
            If you have a 32-bit Windows operating system, but that's talk for much later.
            Here is the first MS-DOS computer. But, what is MS-DOS?
            Let me tell you.
            It was an operating system developed by Microsoft, looks very similar to a regular Terminal. Seen in Command Prompt or anything that is a terminal.
            It was a single-user, single-tasking computer operating system that uses a command line interface. Which in this day & age,
            can get annoying.

            </p>
