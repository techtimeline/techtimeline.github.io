        <center><p>Ah, 1960s to 1970s. I like to call this, the beginning era of technology. Where homes are starting to notice this more & more, and as more people have these. Some people have the ideas to create this all into something beautiful.
            Here's what we dealt with in this time.

            <p> Before Fortnite, there was only this. In this day & age, playing Video Games is easy as turning on your computer.
                Today, you turn on your console and you are instantly one button away from your favorite game.
                But, in 1962 it wasn't that easy.
                Some of us had to manually type out code that the games are written on, to first play them.

                Of course, we don't do this anymore with DRM, Streaming & use of digital media with CDs and USBs.

                But in 1962, Spacewar was the first game ever. Created by Steve Russell and released for the PDP-1 it started something beautiful.
                Later inspiring games like Asteroids, Pong & more to be made.
                This is considered the first video game, ever. And guess what! It was on PC!

                PC master race.

         <p> You might be wondering what this is, and you might not even care about this.
             But this is the foundation of the Internet as we know it.
             1967, a weird unusual year. But little did we all know this was the foundation of what you are using
             to visit this website.

             Made in 1967, the US created this in a nutshell way to connect computers together.
             And it's the first network to implement TCP and IP.
             These again, became the technical foundation of the Internet.
