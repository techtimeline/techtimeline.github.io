            <p> In 2010, Steve Jobs announced the iPad. Despite critics at this time thinking it would be unneccesary to purchase, calling it an iPhone 
                in a bigger size. But the iPad was much more than that, tablets filled the need for smaller computers. By putting a tactile keyboard, these can
                actually be portable laptops. Filling the void for Netbooks.
                With applications, work apps, and compatibillity with virtualization. Tablets are a needed thing.

            <p>Microsoft learned on from their mistakes that even though Windows Vista looked great for 2006. It's internals and applications weren't the best.
                And in most cases and complaints about Vista, didn't work. We were blessed with Windows 7 which was a more optimized operating system, kept some of the things
                that made Vista beautiful. And made Windows 7 an amazing OS. To this day, it is still used on 39% of Computers. And it's still not obsolete.

            <p>With inspiration and the massive success with the Nintendo Wii, Joysticks were being questioned as not the only way to play a game.
                Microsoft created the Xbox Kinect. A camera which looks at your every move with it's sensors and more. Despite a good concept, it was never
                implemented to stay. And interest wasn't highly made.
