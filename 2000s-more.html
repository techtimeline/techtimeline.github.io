            <p>The 2000s were a very odd era for phones. Blackberry's, Flip Phones, random Windows Phones, and just random things in General.
                Steve Jobs on January 9th, 2007 changed all of this frustration with the iPhone at the MacWorld Convention. 
                Instead of a tactile keyboard, it was in a touch-screen LCD screen. That was an iPod, had Internet and could make phone calls.
                To this day, we still use iPhones.
