       <center> <p>The 90s, we have reached an intervention. </center> 
            Where the world has been changed once again, but to new advancements. Windows became one of the most used operating systems already, the word "Internet" finally became known.
            And more & more humans were being connected together with again the use of the Internet. AOL was dominating, but there was realization that technology could help
            us in our daily life. And we didn't know it yet. But now, we were starting to learn.

    <p>At this time, the ways we connected with the world was by Telegram, Phones, and novelties that most households either didn't have or afford.
        Until 1991, when America Online was introduced to the world. AOL's marketing was genius, they gave you a free Floppy Disk to install the application that lets you surf online for more than a year.
        And of course, we were all hooked. Without America Online, maybe we wouldn't even have the internet.
        Thank your ancestors, always.</p>

    <p>This might not be your typical Android Phone, or iPhone (iOS device) but it was surely one of a kind. For a while at least,
        before all the new tech coming out every year. The IBM Simon was truly ahead of it's future. 
        Considered the first Smartphone, ever. The IBM Simon had a touchscreen, it was handheld.
        But of course, doesn't have crazy specs like we do today. It did have Software Applications, but nothing normal in our era. Like Social Media applications like
        Snapchat or Instagram of course. It had an address book, calendar, appointment scheduler, and a calculator. Which in this time, was very & very useful. </p>
