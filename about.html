 <center> <h1>About Page -- Tech Timeline</h1> </center>
  <p>This website was made for my Technology Class, the assignment was creating a website on regulations on what to have. I made 6 pages on a Navigation Menu to different times and "eras" of technology.
      This could go for Internet, Operating Systems, Programming Languages, Game Consoles and more.</p>
      <p> The website was made in HTML and JavaScript and also using the Bootstrap module. I used Bootstrap for it's simplicity, and also the tools it can also provide. 
          Bootstrap was used heavily in the Timeline for the "Jumbotron"
